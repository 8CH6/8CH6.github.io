      <p>This work takes drama full of traditional Chinese elements as the theme to display, presenting rich ethnic characteristics. The splicing and separation skills of facial components are cleverly used to simulate the "face changing" effect in opera. Text and font design combine Song typeface for Chinese characters and Futura for English, forming a modern, dynamic visual presentation.</p>
