      <p>This work, with the theme of the earth, is created by using multiple modeling methods. Circles drawn by NURBS Modeling represent elements such as the earth. Triangles drawn by polygonal modeling depict mountains and forests, and rectangles represent rivers and houses. The unique perspective presents a sense of "fracture". The perspective view enhances expressiveness.</p>
