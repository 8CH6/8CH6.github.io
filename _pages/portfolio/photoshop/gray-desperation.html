      <p>Using black, white, and gray as the main tones, this work creates a depressing atmosphere through the overlapping effect of human figures and urban buildings. The text "HOPELESS" along with phrases like "DUGU IS THE NORM OF LIFE", "I would take shelter but I do not have a port.", and "You have to keep your loneliness to yourself." conveys a sense of despair—characterized by loneliness and having no place to take refuge. It demonstrates the expression and reflection on people's lonely situation in reality.</p>
