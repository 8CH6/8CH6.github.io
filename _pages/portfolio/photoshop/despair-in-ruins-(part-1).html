      <p>The image shows the back of a person standing in a ruined city, with an overall dark tone. The word "HOPELESS" and sentences such as "I would take shelter but I do not have a port.", "DUGU IS THE NORM OF LIFE" and "You have to keep your loneliness to yourself." convey a sense of loneliness and despair amid the dilapidated environment. It creates a depressing and helpless atmosphere, demonstrating the expression and reflection on the desperate situation.</p>
