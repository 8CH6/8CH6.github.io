      <p>The image shows the back of a person standing in front of urban buildings, with an overall dark tone. The word "HOPELESS" and sentences like "I would take shelter but I do not have a port.", "DUGU IS THE NORM OF LIFE" and "You have to keep your loneliness to yourself." convey emotions of loneliness and despair, create a depressing atmosphere, and express the presentation and reflection on the desperate situation.</p>
