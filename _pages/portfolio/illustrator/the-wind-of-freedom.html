  <div class="work-description">
    <p>Using black and white lines as the medium, this work shapes an image where figures blend with the wind through dynamic lines. These lines not only outline the figures' contours but also simulate the flow of the wind. By eliminating color distractions, it purely interprets a state of freedom like the intangible wind—embracing and propelling individuals—conveying the yearning for and expression of freedom.</p>
