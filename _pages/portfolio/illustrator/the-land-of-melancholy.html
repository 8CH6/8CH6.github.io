    <p>Against a black background, colors like pink and blue are paired. The main figure is combined with elements such as teardrops and broken hearts, while the words "TEARS" and "SAD" enhance the sad atmosphere. Through color contrast and the use of symbols, the work creates a space filled with melancholy, conveying a deep sense of sorrow and melancholy.</p>
