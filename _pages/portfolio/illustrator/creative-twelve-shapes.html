    <p>Focusing on the geometric elements of "points, lines, and planes", this work presents twelve groups of creative geometric compositions. Through the aggregation of points, winding of lines, and combination of planes, these figures exhibit diverse visual effects—some resemble rotating vortices, some like blooming flowers, and others display intricate grids. Set against a black background, they highlight the sense of order and artistic creativity of geometric shapes, embodying the exploration and expression of the aesthetics of geometric composition.</p>
