      <p>This personal logo design takes the initials of the name as its core element, with the letters arranged from left to right to ensure readability. It uses a sans-serif font to create a fresh and modern visual effect; the font strokes vary in thickness, adding a sense of casual vitality and artistry. Green is chosen as the main color, which symbolizes vigorous vitality, helps people relax, and represents luck and environmental awareness.</p>
