    <p>The work Black and White Illusions presents nine sets of geometric patterns using pure black and white tones. Basic geometric elements such as diamonds, triangles, and circles are skillfully combined and arranged to create rich visual effects—some seem to produce a dynamic illusion, while others exhibit a sense of spatial extension. By utilizing black-and-white contrast and graphic composition, it creates interesting and imaginative visual illusions, demonstrating the unique artistic expressiveness and visual tension of geometric figures in a black-and-white context.</p>
