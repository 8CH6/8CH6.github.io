    <p>This portfolio draws on Kandinsky's style and skillfully uses abstract graphics to vividly show the abundance of pollutants. The unique form of expression endows the picture with strong penetrating power and makes it more three-dimensional. It seems to lead the viewers to penetrate through layers of mist and directly hit the core of the pollution problem, triggering people's profound reflection on the current environmental situation.</p>
