    <p>Taking vivid and colorful geometric shapes as the core elements, this work features shapes like circles, squares, and diamonds. These geometric forms intertwine and combine through rich yet harmonious color matching. The overall design not only showcases the sense of order and simplicity of geometric shapes, but also creates a lively and creative visual effect by virtue of color collision and integration. It conveys the unique vitality and artistic tension of geometric art under the rendering of colors.</p>
