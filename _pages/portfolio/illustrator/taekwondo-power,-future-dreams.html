    <p>The poster uses bright yellow as its main tone, exuding vitality and appeal. The cartoon-style taekwondo figures are vivid and lively, with powerful movements that quickly catch the eye. The text information is clearly laid out, and details like promotional offers and course prices are highlighted in color blocks of different shapes—such as orange explosion shapes and blue star shapes. This design is both lively and effective in conveying information; its overall style combines playfulness with promotional practicality, fitting the feature that taekwondo summer courses target teenagers and similar groups.</p>
