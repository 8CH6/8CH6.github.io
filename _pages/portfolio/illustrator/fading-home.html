      <p>Taking blue as the main tone, this work combines visual symbols of ice and snow. The glacier-like shape at the top echoes the "HOME" text below—covered in "ice and snow" and seemingly melting—directly showing the gradual disappearance of polar homes like the Antarctic due to global warming. The text cites data to highlight climate issues such as Antarctic warming since 1989. Combining visuals and text, it calls for attention to global warming’s damage to polar homes, conveying anxiety over lost homes and an appeal for environmental protection.</p>
