      <p>Centered on rich colors and traditional patterns, this work uses classic elements such as circles and scrolling grass patterns. Through colorful matching and symmetrical layout, these elements construct decorative patterns with distinct layers. The collision of colors and combination of patterns not only showcase the exquisiteness and sense of order of traditional art, but also inject modern vitality into tradition via vivid tones. It conveys tribute to traditional aesthetics and innovative expressions, presenting the unique charm of tradition under the reflection of colors.</p>
