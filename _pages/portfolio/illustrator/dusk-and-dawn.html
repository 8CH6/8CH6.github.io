      <p>Taking black, white, and gray as the main tones, this work integrates elements like the moon, sun, and stars with geometric shapes. Through the combination of lines and forms, it creates a sense of time and space for the alternation of day and night. The neatness of geometry intertwines with the imagery of celestial bodies—this not only embodies the tranquility and transition of dawn and dusk, but also conveys the order and poetry contained in the alternation of day and night through abstract visual language, showcasing the unique beauty of the passage of time.</p>
