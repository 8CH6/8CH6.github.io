      <p>This portfolio is presented in an abstract way. It uses the feeling of tree branches to represent human blood vessels. The blue dots invite people to imagine the flowing blood in life. The works deeply explore the connection between nature and the human body, bringing a vivid and thought-provoking visual experience and urging us to cherish the precious gift of life.</p>
