    <p>This portfolio draws on Kandinsky's style and uses abstract graphics to represent the natural environment. The sun symbolizes light and natural energy. The circle represents circulation, such as the change of seasons and the ecological cycle. The element of birds adds agility and vitality, symbolizing the freedom and vitality of nature. This work triggers thoughts on reverence for nature and environmental protection.</p>
