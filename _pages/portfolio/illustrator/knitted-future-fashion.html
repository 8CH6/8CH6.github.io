    <p>This work presents content related to hand-woven clothing from "YERA STUDIO". Integrating elements of Chinese ethnic minorities, the image showcases the fashion style of "NOBILITY AND ELEGANCE" and "SHOW INDIVIDUALITY" through colorful, exquisitely patterned knitted clothing and accessories. It conveys the concept of integrating traditional hand-weaving with modern fashion to create a future-oriented knitted fashion that combines personality and style.</p>
